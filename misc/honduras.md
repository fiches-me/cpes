Greetings: A simple "buenos días" can go a long way in making new friends. It's polite to greet shop assistants and locals, especially in smaller towns.

Family: Family is very important in Honduras, and children often grow up close to their parents. It's common for Hondurans to share their family backgrounds with visitors.

Cultural Sensitivity: Anti-gay attitudes are prevalent, and while not illegal, public displays of affection between same-sex couples are frowned upon.

Language: The official language is Spanish, but there are also indigenous languages spoken in the country. It's important to be respectful and use formal titles when addressing someone older or in a position of authority.
