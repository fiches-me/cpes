### 1. **Business Hours and Punctuality**

* **Hours**: Business hours are typically **8:00 AM to 5:00 PM**, though flexibility is common. Meetings may start later in the day (e.g., 11:00 AM) and end by 4:00 PM.
* **Punctuality**: While punctuality is valued, it is often more lenient than in some Western cultures. Arriving 15–30 minutes early is common to build rapport.

### 2. **Personal Relationships**

* **Building Trust**: Business dealings often begin with personal connections. Take time to build relationships before discussing formal business.
* **Formal Titles**: Use formal titles (e.g., "Señor," "Señora") in professional settings, but familiarity may develop over time.

### 3. **Communication Style**

* **Directness**: Communication is generally straightforward, though maintaining harmony is important. Avoid overly critical feedback during meetings.
* **Language**: Spanish is the primary language. Learning basic Spanish phrases (e.g., "Gracias" for "Thank you") shows respect.

### 4. **Negotiation and Decision-Making**

* **Collaborative**: Negotiations are often collaborative, with emphasis on long-term relationships over short-term gains.
* **Patience**: Decisions may take longer as stakeholders (e.g., family members) may influence outcomes.

### 5. **Social Etiquette**

* **Gifts**: Small gifts (e.g., chocolate, local crafts) are acceptable to build rapport, but avoid expensive or inappropriate items.
* **Dining**: Meals are social events. Arrive on time, but it’s common to eat slowly and enjoy conversation. Avoid overly formal dining habits.
- Catholicism is prevalent, so being respectful of religious practices is advisable.

### 6. **Cultural Considerations**
- Respect hierarchical structures. Avoid challenging superiors directly.
-  Be mindful of Honduran holidays and regional differences in business practices.
