| Increase inequalities between rich & poors             | Logical evolution of humanity. Transhumanism would be democratised and accesible from everyone. Such technologies would allow humans to be better. Mandatory on a Geopolitical point of vue. |
| Pollution created by such technologies                 |                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| No energy                                              | Energy is coming directly from your brain (C.F. C2N) as you can't plug in yourself.                                                                                                          |
| Create inequalities between having such and not having | Not an inequality if it's a real choice. So we need progress to democratize it.                                                                                                              |

## Document Study

**List of arguments from the document:**

- Immortality (*kiss the infinity*). We need time to pursue our goals. Devalue Time. Strees of population? Spirit of data (C.F kurgesartz).
- Emphasize the fact that we are already in it. Ethics is on the way, critics is pessimistic.
- Need research, as a geopolitical concern. We can't be behind another time. 
- Freedom to decide what you can do with your body -> out of physical boundaries.
