## Document Study

**List of arguments from the document:**

- Immortality (*kiss the infinity*). We need time to pursue our goals. Devalue Time. Strees of population? Spirit of data (C.F kurgesartz).
- Emphasize the fact that we are already in it. Ethics is on the way, critics is pessimistic.
- Need research, as a geopolitical concern. We can't be behind another time. 
- Freedom to decide what you can do with your body -> out of physical boundaries.
