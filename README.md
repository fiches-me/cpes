> [!WARNING]
> **The lang structure is not established yet!** While I wanted to have a cross lang website, with both french & english (to reflect the way our cursus work) I published the [summer sheets](./juillet-aout/index) kind of into a rush and didn't applied it. If you have any idea/structure in your head, feel free to share it! A comment is shipped on every sheet containing this warning.

## 🇫🇷 Comment ça marche
Ce repo regroupe un ensemble de fiches de révision écrites [en markdown](./contribution/101). Chaque fichier `index` définie une catégorie, qui possède elle même plusieurs fiches. 

## 🇬🇧 How-To
This repo contains multiples revision sheets write [using markdown](./contribution/101). Each `index` file represent a categorie, which contains other .md files which refers as sheets.
