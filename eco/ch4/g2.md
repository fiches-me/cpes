# The modeling of Keynesian macroeconomics
## Economic formalisation of the Keynesian model
### Some neoclassical inheritance
Here, with the Keynesian model, there are less graphical representations, but still important equations. 

As we seen, Keynes was not a huge modeler, and so most of the maths formalisations came after the death of Keynes. John Hicks lead them.

Keynes was still influenced by neoclassical. We still have Y = C + I and Y = C + S (S = Saving, what empower I = Investment). But, there is an inverted correlation. For neoclassical, $\gamma \rightarrow C \text{ and } I$. For Keynes, $C \text{ and } I \rightarrow \gamma$. So, there is a choice between Consumption and Savings. Also, for Keynes, $I \ne S$, as we will se in [Investment drivers](#Investment%20drivers).
### The propensity to consume
Keynes shows that households have a different mean propensity to consume (*moyenne de consommer*). This can be compute with $c = \frac{C}{\gamma}$.
This way, richer you are, **less the part of your revenue will be**. So, you save more and you will, at the end, create more investment. Malthus. The marginal propensity to consume is computed as $c_m = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \gamma} = c = \frac{C}{\gamma}$.
$C = c . Y + C_♡$ with $C_♡$ the minimal consumption needed to survive.
