# The modeling of Keynesian macroeconomics
## Economic formalisation of the Keynesian model
### Some neoclassical inheritance
Here, with the Keynesian model, there are less graphical representations, but still important equations. 

As we seen, Keynes was not a huge modeler, and so most of the maths formalisations came after the death of Keynes. John Hicks lead them.

Keynes was still influenced by neoclassical. We still have Y = C + I and Y = C + S (S = Saving, what empower I = Investment). But, there is an inverted correlation. For neoclassical, $\gamma \rightarrow C \text{ and } I$. For Keynes, $C \text{ and } I \rightarrow \gamma$. So, there is a choice between Consumption and Savings. Also, for Keynes, $I \ne S$, as we will se in [Investment drivers](#Investment%20drivers).
### The propensity to consume
Keynes shows that households have a different mean propensity to consume (*moyenne de consommer*). This can be compute with $c = \frac{C}{\gamma}$.
This way, richer you are, **less the part of your revenue will be**. So, you save more and you will, at the end, create more investment. Malthus. The marginal propensity to consume is computed as $c_m = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \gamma} = c = \frac{C}{\gamma}$.
$C = c . Y + C_♡$ with $C_♡$ the minimal consumption needed to survive.
### The 45-degrees diagram
The 45-degrees diagram (also called "kenesyan cross") is a graphical formulation of **Paul Samuelson**, one of the most important Neokenyesian. With *John Hicks*, they will build up **the synthesis**, a work to link neoclassical and Keynesian researches.

This graph represent when Y=Z, when the aggregated production is equal to the global demand. Before Y', the situation is a sur-production. After, it shows too much inequalities between poor and riches. This way, taking the richs increase C and so redirect the goods to the poors.

Y' should lead to full employment ($Y_{FE}$), but it's not. As we saw with Warlas Law, one market must have not been equilibrium, such as the money one. Also, some unemployment is inevitable, such as people's moving or geological missrepartitions, which are called **Structural Unemployment**.

**Theses reasons are not the same as Neoclasiccals**
### Keynesian multiplier’s computation
#### Example case: No State
Without State, the equilibrium can be computed with Y = C + I, which, at the end, gives $Y = \frac{1}{1 - c} ( C + I )$. Here, the multiplier is always higher than one. So, any increase in investment will trigger a bennefic circle of increase of production, limited by the Fundamental Psycoligical Law

> [!EXAMPLE] Fundamental Psycoligical Law
> Keynes’ Fundamental Psychological Law states that as income rises, people increase their consumption, but by less than the increase in income (i.e., the marginal propensity to consume is positive but < 1).
> 
> This behavior is what gives the Keynesian multiplier its force: because each round of spending is only partially re-spent, the initial increase in demand creates a multiplied—yet finite—expansion of total income. In short, the law is the behavioral foundation that determines the size of the multiplier.

#### Open Economy
In an open economy (with state), the model can be enriched :
$$Y = \frac{1}{1 - c + m + t} (C + I + G + X)$$

The value of $\frac{1}{1 - c + m + t}$ is not always superior to 1. Such, we need to have a close look ln any state intervention to be sure that it have a benefic impact overall.

In theses two systems, **Investment** is a central part that empower the rest. That's why we will focus on Investment next.

#### Application: Document 4
1. C = 0.8Y + 580 -> c = 0.8 & $C_♡$ = 580
   Y = C + G + I
   Y = 0,8Y + 580 + 700 + 600
   Y = $\frac{1880}{0.2}$ = 9400
   C =  0.8 . 9400 + 580 = 8100
2. Y = 8900, C=7700
   $\Delta G = -100, \Delta Y = - 500, \Delta C = -400$
   -> La baisse de la consommation entraîne la baisse de la production, *et pas l'inverse*.
3. Increase in public expanses increase directly the level of production.
   G -> Y -> C -> Y -> C...
4.  $\Delta G = 100, \Delta Y =  500, k = 5$
   ou $\frac{1}{1 - c} = \frac{1}{0.2} = 5$
## Investment drivers
### The importance of profitability
We need to acknowledge the difference bewteen Profits vs profitability. For classics and neoclassic, **Profit** ($\pi$) drive production. A firm is *sick* of profit, and will do *anything they can* to maximize their profits. To achieve this goal, you can :
- Minimize the Cost Function $C(q) = q^2$
- Maximize the Output $p \times q$
So, the profit function can be computed as followed:
$$\pi = p \times q - C(q)$$
One small example with p = 10 and q = 1000: $\pi = 10,000 - 1,000,000 = -90,000$
Or, C(q) is driver by Savings (= Investments thanks to Say's Law).

Michal Kalecki, a "bridge" between certain classics and Keynes, try to understand why their are big fluctuations in the economy (in term of productions). He also published a book, <u>A Theory On Profits</u>, which resolves around the reasons of Profits. 

He consider that capitalists will decided the level of employment that will maximize their profit **according to** the goods and services **demand**. In the short run equilibrium, their observations are right. Once their done their computations, all productions on any market do depends on demand. But this demand is from revenues that are from production. **Demand determine production which determine demand.** When you hire new workers to produce, you also create a source of revenue that increase the global demand. Capitalists, on goods & services markets, will se their profits rise as long as their paid the workers. Investment is not coming from savings, but more that an **anticipated profit** (noted $\pi^e$, powers serves only as notations)

*We are going to a concept of profitaiblity*

The Tobin's Q is a law to see if they can anticipate if an investment will be interesting or not. Its computed as follow :
$$ Q = \frac{\text{Equity market value fo the firm}}{\text{Replacement value of the fixed capital}}$$
Equity market value for the firm is basically the shares of the firm (*actions*), so the number of shares times their values. The Replacement value of the fixed capital is the interest rate. If Q is higher than one, then the firm is profitable. If not, then it's not.

Tobin's Q is deeply related to the Keynesian Anticipation. Profitability is what Keynes used to call the "business climate".

BUT, If you have a good profitability, then the market thinks it's fine for you and so create a sort self-fulfilling prophecy.

Eventually, unlike neoclassicals that explain investment by profit, Keynesians explain investment by profitability lead by the anticipation of the market. 
### The accelerator effect

This other effect didn't grabbed as fame as the Keynesian Multiplicator. The accelerator effect, unlike the multiplicator, will take a look at the **supply**. We will see how do investment impact supply and then demand. 

> [!NOTE]
> The idea of the accelerator is previous than the Multiplicator, and also previous from Keynes as it was formalized by Clark in 1917.

We are in a similar reflection to Kalecki. The idea is that the stock of capital K is proportional to the level of production ($\gamma = a \times K$). There is no production output that is not used (every machine is used). 

**This model is the first to take into account investment, and to compute the investment's accumulation.**

$$
K_t = v \times \gamma_t \text{  with  } v = \frac{K}{\gamma}
\Longleftrightarrow
K_{t + 1} - K_t = v(\gamma_{t + 1} - \gamma_t) = I_t
$$
$v$ is supposed to be constant (independent from the period, factor of the economy's structure).

#### Example
Generally, $0 < v < 1$, but here, to simplify computations, we will take $v = 2$. When $\Delta \gamma = + 10, \gamma_{t+1} - \gamma_t = 10$ so $10 \times v = 10 \times 2 = 20$

In the simple accelerator model, **if production decrease, then investment will decrease too.** This model implies an endogenous explanation of the economy.
