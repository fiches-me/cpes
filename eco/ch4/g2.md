# The modeling of Keynesian macroeconomics
## Economic formalisation of the Keynesian model
### Some neoclassical inheritance
Here, with the Keynesian model, there are less graphical representations, but still important equations. 

As we seen, Keynes was not a huge modeler, and so most of the maths formalisations came after the death of Keynes. John Hicks lead them.

Keynes was still influenced by neoclassical. We still have Y = C + I and Y = C + S (S = Saving, what empower I = Investment). But, there is an inverted correlation. For neoclassical, $\gamma \rightarrow C \text{ and } I$. For Keynes, $C \text{ and } I \rightarrow \gamma$. So, there is a choice between Consumption and Savings. Also, for Keynes, $I \ne S$, as we will se in [Investment drivers](#Investment%20drivers).
### The propensity to consume
Keynes shows that households have a different mean propensity to consume (*moyenne de consommer*). This can be compute with $c = \frac{C}{\gamma}$.
This way, richer you are, **less the part of your revenue will be**. So, you save more and you will, at the end, create more investment. Malthus. The marginal propensity to consume is computed as $c_m = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \gamma} = c = \frac{C}{\gamma}$.
$C = c . Y + C_♡$ with $C_♡$ the minimal consumption needed to survive.
### The 45-degrees diagram
The 45-degrees diagram (also called "kenesyan cross") is a graphical formulation of **Paul Samuelson**, one of the most important Neokenyesian. With *John Hicks*, they will build up **the synthesis**, a work to link neoclassical and Keynesian researches.

This graph represent when Y=Z, when the aggregated production is equal to the global demand. Before Y', the situation is a sur-production. After, it shows too much inequalities between poor and riches. This way, taking the richs increase C and so redirect the goods to the poors.

Y' should lead to full employment ($Y_{FE}$), but it's not. As we saw with Warlas Law, one market must have not been equilibrium, such as the money one. Also, some unemployment is inevitable, such as people's moving or geological missrepartitions, which are called **Structural Unemployment**.

**Theses reasons are not the same as Neoclasiccals**
### Keynesian multiplier’s computation
#### Example case: No State
Without State, the equilibrium can be computed with Y = C + I, which, at the end, gives $Y = \frac{1}{1 - c} ( C + I )$. Here, the multiplier is always higher than one. So, any increase in investment will trigger a bennefic circle of increase of production, limited by the Fundamental Psycoligical Law

> [!EXAMPLE] Fundamental Psycoligical Law
> Keynes’ Fundamental Psychological Law states that as income rises, people increase their consumption, but by less than the increase in income (i.e., the marginal propensity to consume is positive but < 1).
> 
> This behavior is what gives the Keynesian multiplier its force: because each round of spending is only partially re-spent, the initial increase in demand creates a multiplied—yet finite—expansion of total income. In short, the law is the behavioral foundation that determines the size of the multiplier.

#### Open Economy
In an open economy (with state), the model can be enriched :
$$Y = \frac{1}{1 - c + m + t} (C + I + G + X)$$

The value of $\frac{1}{1 - c + m + t}$ is not always superior to 1. Such, we need to have a close look ln any state intervention to be sure that it have a benefic impact overall.

In theses two systems, **Investment** is a central part that empower the rest. That's why we will focus on Investment next.
