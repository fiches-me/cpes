# The modeling of Keynesian macroeconomics

## Economic formalization of the Keynesian model

### Some neoclassical inheritance

With the Keynesian model, there are fewer graphical representations, but equations remain important.

As we have seen, Keynes was not a huge modeler, so most of the mathematical formalizations came after his death. **John Hicks** led this effort.

Keynes was still influenced by neoclassicals. We still have $Y = C + I$ and $Y = C + S$ (where $S$ = Saving, which empowers $I$ = Investment). But, there is an **inverse causality**.
*   For neoclassicals: $Y \rightarrow C \text{ and } I$.
*   For Keynes: $C \text{ and } I \rightarrow Y$.

So, there is a choice between Consumption and Savings. Also, for Keynes, $I \neq S$, as we will see in the investment section.

### The propensity to consume

Keynes shows that households have a different **average propensity to consume** (*propension moyenne à consommer*). This can be computed with $c = \frac{C}{Y}$.

The richer you are, the **smaller the part of your revenue consumed**. So, you save more.
The **marginal propensity to consume** is computed as $c_m = \frac{\partial C}{\partial Y}$.

The consumption function is:
$$C = c \cdot Y + C_0$$
with $C_0$ being the **autonomous consumption** (minimal consumption needed to survive).

### The 45-degree diagram

The 45-degree diagram (also called the "**Keynesian Cross**") is a graphical formulation by **Paul Samuelson**, one of the most important Neo-Keynesians. With *John Hicks*, they built **the Synthesis**, a work linking neoclassical and Keynesian research.

This graph represents when $Y=Z$, i.e., when aggregated production is equal to global demand.
*   Before the equilibrium point $Y^*$, there is **under-production** (Demand > Supply).
*   After $Y^*$, there is **over-production** (Supply > Demand).

$Y^*$ should lead to full employment ($Y_{FE}$), but it often does not. As we saw with **Walras's Law**, if one market is in equilibrium, others might not be.
Also, some unemployment is inevitable, such as due to people moving or geographical mismatches, which is called **Structural Unemployment**.

**These reasons are not the same as for Neoclassicals.**

### Keynesian multiplier’s computation

#### Example case: No State

Without the State, the equilibrium can be computed with $Y = C + I$, which gives:
$$Y = \frac{1}{1 - c} ( C_0 + I )$$
Here, the multiplier $k = \frac{1}{1-c}$ is always higher than one (since $0 < c < 1$). So, any increase in investment will trigger a beneficial circle of increased production, limited by the Fundamental Psychological Law.

> [!NOTE] Fundamental Psychological Law
> Keynes’ **Fundamental Psychological Law** states that as income rises, people increase their consumption, but by less than the increase in income (i.e., the marginal propensity to consume is positive but $< 1$).
>
> This behavior gives the Keynesian multiplier its force: because each round of spending is only partially re-spent, the initial increase in demand creates a multiplied—yet finite—expansion of total income.

#### Open Economy

In an open economy (with the State), the model can be enriched:
$$Y = \frac{1}{1 - c + m + t} (C_0 + I + G + X)$$

The value of the multiplier $\frac{1}{1 - c + m + t}$ is not always superior to 1 (due to imports $m$ and taxes $t$). Thus, we need to look closely at any state intervention to be sure it has a beneficial impact overall.

In these two systems, **Investment** is a central part that empowers the rest.

#### Application: Document 4

1.  Given $C = 0.8Y + 580$ (so $c = 0.8$ & $C_0 = 580$) and $I = 600, G = 700$.
    $$Y = C + I + G$$
    $$Y = 0.8Y + 580 + 600 + 700$$
    $$Y - 0.8Y = 1880$$
    $$0.2Y = 1880$$
    $$Y = \frac{1880}{0.2} = 9400$$
    $$C = 0.8 \times 9400 + 580 = 7520 + 580 = 8100$$

2.  If $Y = 8900$ and $C = 7700$:
    $\Delta G = -100 \implies \Delta Y = k \cdot \Delta G = 5 \cdot (-100) = -500$.
    New $Y = 9400 - 500 = 8900$.
    $\Delta C = c \cdot \Delta Y = 0.8 \cdot (-500) = -400$.
    New $C = 8100 - 400 = 7700$.
