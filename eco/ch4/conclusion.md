# Conclusion
Michel Beaud & Gilles Dostaler, in <u>s</u> consider the 40s (45 after the war) to the 70s as the golden age of interventionist policies. Keynes analysis where dominating. This lead to conceptual keynessians, **Neo-Keynesians**, and political, **Post-Keynesian**

<!---
Not from me:

Keynesian economics fundamentally shifted the focus from supply-side to **demand-side** economics. By challenging the self-regulating nature of markets and introducing concepts like **sticky wages**, **liquidity preference**, and the **multiplier effect**, Keynes provided a framework for understanding and managing economic crises.

The role of the **State** became central, not just as a regulator but as an active participant capable of smoothing out the business cycle through **fiscal** and **monetary** policies. While the "Golden Age" of Keynesianism faced challenges in the 1970s (stagflation), its core insights remain vital for modern macroeconomic analysis.
