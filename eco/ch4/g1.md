# The Keynesian revolution

## A complete break with the neoclassical

### A moral revolution

*He was aware that he was written in a hard political and economic time (rising of the H and the Great Depression).* He hopped to gives back the economy to politics to help them govern.

Keynes thinks that in around a hundred years, the economic problem will be solved. Humans will not have to works from them, thanks to the technical progress. And so, humans could use their free time to other things, such as philosophy and art. In the future, the challenge is to use our free time wisely (in a good way). Loosing the tradition of working will be difficult (as they are too dump). He thinks people are sick of the money.

To achieve theses goals, we need to achieve theses four goals first:
1. Control Demography evolution
2. Brings Peace on the world
3. Have Faith in Science
4. Growth <u>under conditions</u>

Then, economists would be like dentists: they will take a look at the problems of the economy and *health* them.

The models built by the neoclassical are not good enough for the crisis: so we need to build a new one. We need to create a model that can **understand** the big institutions of capitalism, within 2 in particular: **money** and **wage labor**. déflation + chômage. 

### A Monetary Production Economy (**MPE**)

The vision of the economy, as what is around us, will also be revolutionized. *He almost called his book "monetary theory of production" as how it was important*. Studying only the production is the limit of the neoclassic theory, and even more when crisis. As you have deflation and unemployment, we need to study the money & labor market. **The money NEED to be studied.** 

First and for all, the money **have a central role**. The money isn't neutral. Money is the prefer means of agents to detain wealth. Because people want te be wealthy, they desire money. So they want money to be richer, not to buy things.

Franck Van de Velde is a Kenesian economist, which works around the wage labor. Emploies are paid in **money**, *not in something else*. This mean there is a gap between production and appropriation of production's wealth. He will think of a fourth criteria, money is used to pay workers (as follow):

1. Accounting unit
2. Medium of exchange
3. Store of value
4. **Remuneration of worker**

When you invest money, you kind of know what append to it. But when you pay an employee, you never know if these money will be stored or spent.

This way, there is *maybe* a disequilibrium between supply & demand. $S \neq D$. It's only one hypothesis (Say's Law), but yet the most important one and the only one which make everyone "agree".

This way, producers can be considered as *entrepreneurs*, which **anticipates the future to make preset decisions**. This anticipation was never took into account by neoclassical.

In the end, with not neutral money, people may *or may not* want money for itself. And production is an anticipation of the future, and sometime they can fail. This is why Keynes use the term **General uncertainty**.

In Chapter 12, TG, he think about of the radical uncertainty, in the metaphora of the beauty contest. People do as everyone, so let's follow it. But if it collapsed, you'r all dead baby. We are loosing the rational human idea to a "animal spirits" one (as humans have limited mindpower, they acknowledge they will do mistakes and prefer follow others.).

## The truth birth of modern macroeconomics
### The Keynesian multiplier
Neoclassicals are originally a micro-ish analyse. And as the comunity is an aggregation of individuals, macro is just the aggregations of micro. They think like a **brige** (and Keynes of **no-bridge**).
Macroeconomy is not pure abstraction (Java do). We use stylized facts (unemployment, xxx) to analyse the economy globally. This is why we can say this is the truth birth of macro-economics.

The Keynesian Multiplier is inspired by Richard Kahn. It resolves around a $k$ that refers to the rate at which income is multiplied when aggregated investment increases. (*bref le Y ?*). At which point production is sensible to investment? It's kind of an elasticity, for production against another variable, such as state intervention.

The most Keynesian multiplier is the fiscal multiplier (*multiplicateur budgétaire*) which mesure the rise of a government expanse on the production ($G \longrightarrow \gamma$). If K < 1, production is meanly impacted. If k >= 1, it's perfect, as it gives more production.
