# The Keynesian revolution

## A complete break with the neoclassical

### A moral revolution

*He was aware that he was written in a hard political and economic time (rising of the H and the Great Depression).* He hopped to gives back the economy to politics to help them govern.

Keynes thinks that in around a hundred years, the economic problem will be solved. Humans will not have to works from them, thanks to the technical progress. And so, humans could use their free time to other things, such as philosophy and art. In the future, the challenge is to use our free time wisely (in a good way). Loosing the tradition of working will be difficult (as they are too dump). He thinks people are sick of the money.

To achieve theses goals, we need to achieve theses four goals first:
1. Control Demography evolution
2. Brings Peace on the world
3. Have Faith in Science
4. Growth <u>under conditions</u>

Then, economists would be like dentists: they will take a look at the problems of the economy and *health* them.

The models built by the neoclassical are not good enough for the crisis: so we need to build a new one. We need to create a model that can **understand** the big institutions of capitalism, within 2 in particular: **money** and **wage labor**. déflation + chômage. 

### A Monetary Production Economy (**MPE**)
