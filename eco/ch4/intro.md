# Introduction
John Maynard Keynes is a fellow British Cambridge economist. Nowadays, he is considered as the father of the macro-economy. He never used the term of neoclassical and consider them of "just" classics.

The great depression, a crisis in the 1930's, changed is mind and brings him to challenge the actual definitions of the neoclassical dogme. The neoclassical model, which is supposed to be equilibred and provide full employment, is not verified after this crisis. Keynes argue that the Say's low is wrong : he will study the (global) demand instead of the (global) supply. He argue that wages (so work's cost) are rigid and not flexible. It can't vary as easily as neoclassic claims to. 

He defend the *implementation* of fiscal & monetary policies. The State *has* to do something. 

His most famous book is <u>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</u> (**TG**). Occidental economy was following Keynes' advice. Almost all capitalist government  used the Keynes' writing to reduce the impact of the Great Depression.

He is not a true liberalism: he do think that capitalisme is *the best of the worst*. He will actively criticize capitalism while not saying that another one is better.

For him, Economics is **a moral science**. He is against the "mathematical quackery" from the neoclassic as it loose the moral aspect of the economy. He is also critical of Jan Tinbergen, first winner of the Economics Nobel Price, the founder of **econometrics**. In his books, he propose tests for cycles. Keynes was very critical of quantifying cycles in equations. Keynes compare econometrics with alchemy, as an aberration.

Politically, he was a member of the Liberal Party, and believed in the New Liberalism school of thought, focused on social justice, to achieve economic efficiency, political freedom and social justice.
