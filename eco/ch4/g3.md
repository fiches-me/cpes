# 🤯 A new analysis of economic crises

## A new vision of global demand

### The effective demand

According to Keynes, the main driver of the economy is Investment. We already says that investment is mainly driven by anticipated demand, he will only inest if if thinks if his production is sold.

According to Keynes, the main driver of employment  is the factor cost, which can be or capital (user costs) or labor (wages). The *entrepreneur* will only employed if he thinks the proceeds of that employment will be effected to be worth it. 

The effective demand is a synonym of the anticipated demand, it's the one that should be realized if the *entrepreneur* wasn't wrong with his expectations. **It's the one that determine the level of production**, *not the observed one*.

Bad or unstable effective demand lead to unemployment.

Effective demand is finally lead by c, the **marginal propensity to consume**. 

Z = C + I, and as Investment is unstable, so effective demand become unstable too
*Z stands for Effective Demand.*

### The automatic stabilizers

Automatic stabilizers are a way to smooth the fluctuations (chocks) of an economy. Theses works with **proportional fiscality** : having T = tY

1. 
    1. $Y = \frac{1}{1 - c} - cT + \overline{C} + \overline{I} + \overline{G}$
    2. $Y = \frac{1}{1 - 3/4} - 3000 + 1000 + 3000 + 4000$ = 5001
       $k = \frac{1}{1 - 3/4} = 1.3$
    3. Y decrease
2. 
    1. $Y = \frac{1}{1 - c + t} + \overline{C} + \overline{I} + \overline{G}$
    2. $k = \frac{1}{1 - 3/4 + 1/5} = 1.052$

=> Lower multiplier, but less decrease.

## How to regulate the economy

### Principles of the monetary policy

Sometimes, the economy is *really* in crisis. State **has** to do something: It's the Keynes Policies.

A monetary policy have 2 aims:
1. Have money & prices be stable inside the country : Internal
2. Have money stocks be stable : External

One of the solution is **money creation**. You can have 2 different money types, such as:
- Central Bank Moneys (Central Banks to Second Tier Banks)
- Current Money (banks to everyone else)

### The superiority of the fiscal policy
