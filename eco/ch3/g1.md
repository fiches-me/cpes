# ♻️ Markets in a closed economy without State

## The goods and services market

### The composition of GDP

GDP is a measure of production in a certain period of time (we usually look at a year, sometimes a trimester/quarter). 

It's not an indicator that existed when neoclassicism wanted to use it, but it's around the same idea of measuring Wealth. GDP is noted $\gamma$ as $P$ means price.

**How is the GDP computed?** 4 elements are took into account:
1. Consumption $C$
	- Largely by households 
2. Investments $I$ 
3. Publiques  expanses $G$
4. Exchanges with the world (Imports $M$/Exports $X$)
5. Stock variations (machine consumption by time)

$$\gamma = C + I + G + (X - M)$$

*With a close economy, no $G$, $X$ and $M$.* This equation is a expenditoipjapz approach of the GDP

### The goods and services market analyses from the perspective of production

**How firms produces ?** First, you need money, as you can't produce without any starting point. In French, we talk about *Marchés des fonds traitables*. Money is one of these markets. Money is a fully certain financial asset that brings no incomes. In this case, it's an exchange between loaners and borrowers including an interest to the loaner ($r$ for the real interest or $i$ for the nominal interest rate). 

## Financial markets

### A simple financial market: money

Value added is an indicator to mesure Wealth by productive units. Idea that value added I created and not every one participating in the production process. To compute it, you will look for the revenue (P * Q) minus productions units from other companies (also called **intermediate consumption**).  $VA = CA - CI$
