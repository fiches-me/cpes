Economics try to understand how wealth is distributed.  It need simplifications, that's where models come in. Three approaches with a justification for modeling:

- **Inductive reasoning** : large empirical datas to build laws
- **Deductive reasoning** : build laws to create empirical datas
- **Constructivism** : scientific knowledge is always an interpretation of reality, which mean that no static truth exists (like [Montaigne's doubt](https://kerna.fiches.me/philo/ch1/g2)). No model can never fully reflect reality.

Neoclassicals have a more deductive approach. Heterodoxes are more on inductives reasoning.

Here is an example of a simple economic model (jittery because of fiches.me's code).
