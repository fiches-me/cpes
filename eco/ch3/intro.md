Economics tries to understand how wealth is distributed. It needs simplifications, that's where models come in. There are three approaches with a justification for modeling:

- **Inductive reasoning**: Using large empirical data to build laws.
- **Deductive reasoning**: Building laws to create empirical data (or predictions).
- **Constructivism**: Scientific knowledge is always an interpretation of reality. No model can fully reflect reality (similar to [Montaigne's doubt](https://kerna.fiches.me/philo/ch1/g2)).

Neoclassicals have a more deductive approach. Heterodox economists rely more on inductive reasoning.

Here is an example of a simple economic model:

    title "Supply vs Demand"
    x-axis [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    y-axis "Price" 0 --> 15
    line "Demand" [13, 8, 5, 2, 1]
    line "Supply" [1, 2, 5, 8, 13]
