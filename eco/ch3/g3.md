# ⚖️ The equilibrium and its fluctuations

## Economic fluctuations

### Aggregated demand and supply and the equilibrium

**What are Economic fluctuations and what are their impacts?**
We can compute the equilibrium by using the circular flow of income — on the last graph, no money is lost. You have four markets here.

#### Time in economy

Here is some time 

- TCT : < 1 years
- CT (Short Run) : <2 - 3 years
- MT (Medium Run) : 5 ~ 8 yeas
- LT (Lon Run): 10 ~ 30 years
  TLT : ~ 50 ans (no models possibles)

#### Short Run Equilibrium

Here, we will start by the aggregated demand using the circular flaw of incomes. It comes directly from the goods and services market (all the requested goods & services), which are all the arrows going *to* the Goods & Services market. But firms also demands for investments and labour. Finally, State reduce the demand with taxes and importations reduce the demand Here, it's $Z = \gamma = C + I + G + (X - M)$

For the supply, the only arrow interesting here is the sales (because of Say's Law, little neoclassical reminder :).

The idea is that the demand will be higher as the price go lower. The aggregated supply only depend on saves (in the short run) and so is static (again, because of Say's Law).

AS stands for **Aggregated Supply** and AD for **Aggregated Demand**. Output is the GDP

> [!TIP] Furthemore...
> Depending on the trade's balance, the Z axes will be more or less sharp.

### Variety of supply and demand curves: the notion of elasticity

> [!DEFINITION]
> Elasticity is the mesure of reactions of an event on economy, how much buyers and sellers respond to changes to market conditions.

Let's imagine that price of gasoline completely blew up (cause of a random oil crises or a booming Chinea economy that wants *a lot* of it. Or taxes because it's fun). *How to respond to this shit?*  The easy answer is to says that less gasoline will be bough. But *how much* the demand will fall by? **Elasticity will help us answer this question.**

#### Elasticity for Demand (Price Elasticity)
> 🇫🇷 Élasticité prix

Since the quantities adapts to the prices levels, we will look on prices variations. If the demand dose not move that much after a price change, the product is said **inelastic**. On the opposite, it will be called **elastic**. This means that the demand's *courbe* will not have the same shape depending on psychological/sociological/tensions on consumers. Some pasterns are recognizable:

- Close substitues (bien plutôt substituables), if you can switch from apples to pears (*Competition*) -> **very elastic**. 
- Necessity goods (bien de 1ère nécessité) -> **inelastic**.
- Time horizon (horizon temporel) -> elasticity rise with times, as individuals adapt their habbits.
