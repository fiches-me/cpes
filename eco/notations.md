# Notations
## Notations Générales

- $W$ : Wages (salaires)
- $P$ : Price (Prix)
- $\frac{W}{P}$ : Real Wages (salaire réel)
- $L$ = travail (origine: Labor)
- $C$ = Consommation
- $\Large{y}$ = Production
- $S$ = Épargne (origine: X)
- $I$ = Investissement
- $R$ = Real interest rate. $R = \frac{W}{P}$
- $G$ = Public Expanses

## Formules contables
- $\Large{y}\normalsize= C + I + G + (X - M)$[^1] 
- $\Large{y}\normalsize= C + S + T$[^2] 
- $\Large{y}\normalsize= W + Div + S_F$
- Real GDP = $\frac{Nominal GDP}{CPI}$
## Neoclassical framework
- The Money Supply is fixed.
- Idea on equilibrium
	- On wages, with the voluntary unenployment
	  => Circular flow of incomes
- States intervention breaks it
	- Involuntary unenployment as some peoples can't found work to their price (with $W/P_{min}$)
	- surplus lost in good's prices
- International trades benefits from everyone
	- If you are specialized in something, you will gaing more from it
	- If you are not, then it will give you the "opportunity" to do so

## Time in economy 
- TCT : < 1 years
- CT (Short Run) : <2 - 3 years
- MT (Medium Run) : 5 ~ 8 yeas
- LT (Lon Run): 10 ~ 30 years
  TLT : ~ 50 ans (no models possibles)
## Elasticity
The global formula is $\frac{\Delta Q/Q}{\Delta P/P}$
- Close substitues (bien plutôt substituables), if you can switch from apples to pears (*Competition*) -> **very elastic**. 
- Necessity goods (bien de 1ère nécessité) -> **inelastic**.
- Time horizon (horizon temporel) -> elasticity rise with times, as individuals adapt their habits.
