## Artificial Cells

### Cell components

See ~~scheme~~ diagram

### State of production

Vesicles, which are fondations of others. BUT no nucleos (no DNA) and no autonomous power supply.

### Real <-> Artificial comparaison

### Applications

## IA & Proteins

### List the different steps of creating of proteins in the living cells

1. Transcription from DNA to mRNA
2. mRNA moves to cytoplasma
3. ribosomes read mRNA
4. tRNA brings the amino-acids
5. creating a chain

1 codon = 1 amino-acid
Start codon, Stop codon

### Compare ai/real

IA is not really time consuming. Fast. Environment mess.  

### Human Revolution
